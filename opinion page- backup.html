                             There is now a new category for architecture design called the corona-compliant. Architects ask each other if their
                             design is suitable in the world of corona or not. Corona architecture is going to be a hit sooner than later.

                         architecture was infact part of agriculture already, A farmer would have architecture very suitable to his famring techniques
                         and this farming methods and his farmining lifestyle. He would build barns for better producticity. But what the dutch are doing is extremely
                         brilliant, they are actually using house that hold just plants and not people, its like another form of greenhouse.
