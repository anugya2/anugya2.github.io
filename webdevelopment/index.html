                            the team has turned scraps to beauty. This design is one of those examples of when design meets functionality 
                            and efiiciency. But it is not just that, it does more. This project has transformed a mundane act of getting 
                            rid of leftovers into the creation of beautiful art. This pavilion reminds one of old wooden houses with its
                            familiar comforting craoking noises and warmth of home. This pavilion is not just for the eyes though, the 
                            temperature control obrained naturally through wood and spaces between them is a wonderful science.

                             to be a musician's residence. Critics have deemed it an "oasis in arizona". This is beautiful house with a courtyard system
                             with white stucco walls and solar panels. These white walls and the courtyards were particularly insipired by the traditional 
                             courtyard houses in the deserts of Rajasthan. The white surfaces reflect sunlight and avoid trapping of heat and the courtyard
                             provides a buffer between the harsh outside air and the controlled internal temperatures. This desgn is ideal for a desert environment.
                             The designers have kept in mind the efficiency of power and have made the use of solar panels as well.
