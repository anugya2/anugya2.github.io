                    <li>Archdaily:
                        "Archdaily" is an online Architecture magazine.
                        The main page of this website serves as a noticeboard containing snippets of latest articles and news in the field of architecture.
                        All you have to do is open the website to get a quick highlights and stay updated. I am inspired by this idea in their mainpage and have used it in my own website.
                        In my website, the main page contains a slideshow of projects/articles and another section containing snippets of texts and photoes from articles.
                         You have to press the "read more" button to read more, but the page just has jists to keep you updated. This main page serves as a highlights-board as well.

                    <br>
                    <li>Mies Van Der Rohe: Mies is famous for the aphorism "less is more". I have always been inspired by this artist who has a distate for
                        non-functional decorations. His designs are simple, elegant and contain only functional elements, 
                        and aesthetics are not the main priority. I have used this philosophy in my website design as well, I have not compromised 
                        on the usability and functionality of the elements in the website for the sake of aesthetics. I have tried not to be rigid with my
                        website-appearance-design, and have revisited and revised them to make the site simple and more functional.

                    <br>
                    <li>Google image category selector: I am inspired by how google-image allows you to choose subcategories for whatever image you are searching for.
                        I have used this concept in one of my pages, where you can sort out the interior design ideas based on color.

                        Media query has been used to make elements readable and suitable for smaller screens like mobile and tablet.

                <ul>
                    <li>Grids and flex boxes: To create a responsive website with suitable desired layouts, i had to learn to 
                        use grids and flexboxes. I learnt it through pages on "developer.mozilla.org" and "www.w3schools.com". I also learnt 
                        it through a online educational game called "flex-box froggy" and "grid garden". Similarly, while implementing
                        grids and flexboxes, I came across many small issues, I found answers to these issues on "stack overflow" forums.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Animated buttons: I learnt this very amusing technique of merging css-animation with some javascript
                        to create animated buttons. I realised that I could create any animation by using a long strip of images (at every step of animation)
                        / a film strip. Using this film strip as a background for the button, I could use css animation to make this background move across the button , to create animations.
                        The javascript part of this, I learnt it throught the Introduction to programming module and through videos in this course itself.
                        The css animation, I learnt it through the w3schools. And this technique itself, I stumbled across it on stach overflow when I was searching for other answers.
                        While writing js code, I had to learn different ways of getting dom elements such as queryselector, getdocumentsbyid, etc. I also had to learn
                        js codes that manipulate dom such as toggleclass, changing css through js, and changing classnames and values of input tags.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Image carousel: I started with a code for a simple carousel from w3schools. In html, 
                        I changed the tags, tag classes and ids and media to fit my site. To make it my own, I added a timer bar 
                        to the carousel. I also added an animation that changes the color of the
                        texts on the images with time. In javascript, I added new variable and new code to make the timer bar functional and
                        for the text-color-animation change to work. While, trying to make this happen, I had to learn in depth about
                        css selectors and DOM manipulation as well. I learnt it from sources mentioned in the above point.

                <ul>
                    <li>Responsive grids: The website layout is very responsive. In some areas, I have 4 columned grids
                        that become 3 columned, 2 columned and single column respectively as the screen size becomes smaller.
                        The navigation bar turns into hamburger button in smaller screens. The footer gets rids of some bulky texts in smaller screens.

                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Javascripts used in buttons: I have used javascript to make the "Read-more" buttons, favourite/heart animation buttons, 
                        Price calculator in shopping page, Delete buttons, Buy-now button. These smart buttons have made my website very interactive and functional.

                   </li>
                   <br>
                   <li>Sorting content by color: In the "Interior" page, we can sort through images by the colors they are. This has been a success,
                       the code works perfectly and shows only the color that the user wants to see. It makes the page very interactive
                       and users get some control over whats displayed.
                   </li>
                   <br>
                   <li>
                       Hover animation: I have been succesfully able to use hover animations to enlarge elements (colored spheres in "Interior" page), highlight links and highlight buttons.
                   </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Accessibility: Given another chance at this website,
                         I would add a dark mode for the pages and also, font
                          enlargement buttons on each page.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Effectiveness of CSS Selectors: The css selectors in the style pages are not as effective and precise as they can be.
                        Imprecise use of the selectors has resulted in repition of the styling code. Inability to target specific selectors has resulted in lengthy styling code.

                   </li>
                   <br>
                   <li>Use of tools like templating systems and  external js libraries: There is room for use of tools like handelbars.js, with which,
                       it would be easier to manipulate the DOM in bulk and get things like "dark mode" in the website easily.
                   </li>

                   <li>
                      Lack of complex/Artistic layouts: The layout used in this site is very simple and basic, but the use of a 
                      more layered and advanced layout would make this site more interesting. 
                   </li>

                   <li>
                   Bulky and repititive js code: There is room for improvement at making the js code more elegant and less repititive.
